Playrn Dapp

A platform in which musicians can make drops of their music and the fans can listen to them and be 
rewarded with tokens that they can exchange for NFTs with different utilities like meet and greets, 
special merch, backstage, front row, special prices for tickets.  

Promote co - listenings to get additional rewards, the larger the group the bigger the reward.  
People can also become curators by paying artists to repost their sounds on their personal profiles 
and if other users listen to the tracks from their profile they also earn play tokens. 
You can comment on the artist's posts if you pay the artist.
